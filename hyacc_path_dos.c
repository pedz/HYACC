/*
 * hyacc_path_dos.c
 *
 * Retrieve files hyaccpar and hyaccmanpage.
 * This is used by DOS/Windows version only.
 *
 * 1) If set USE_CUR_DIR to 0:
 *
 * After compilation, put hyacc.exe, hyaccmanpage and hyaccpar
 * to c:\windows\. Since this folder by default is in the system
 * path variable, hyacc becomes a command that you can use 
 * wherever you are in windows.
 *
 * You can also change the path here, and put hyacc and hyaccmanpage
 * and hyaccpar elsewhere, but then you may need to add the path
 * to system searchable path, so the system can find it.
 *
 * You also can remove the c:\\windows from the path here, then
 * hyacc will search in the current directory for them.
 *
 * 2) Otherwise, if set USE_CUR_DIR to 1:
 *
 * Then hyacc searches in the current directory.
